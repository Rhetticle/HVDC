# Casing
The casing for HVDC was modelled in Fusion 360 and is comprised of three parts namely the bottom piece, top piece and isolating plate. The plate isolates the battery from the potentially high voltage of the output capacitors.

A insulator was made to hold the transformer to be potted in epoxy resin. As the arc distance of the transformer pins is shorter then the final air gap of the device, the transformer pins needed to be isolated from each other.
Standard self-leveling craft resin was used to achieve this
